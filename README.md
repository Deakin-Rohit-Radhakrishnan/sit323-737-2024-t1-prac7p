Steps to Set Up MongoDB in Kubernetes:

we have reused the codes from the previous task and implemented the mongodb as shown below:

1. Install MongoDB in Kubernetes
Install MongoDB in your Kubernetes cluster, either as a standalone instance or as a replica set. The choice depends on your application requirements, such as high availability or fault tolerance. A standalone MongoDB instance is simpler to set up but does not provide redundancy, while a replica set offers data replication for higher availability.

2. Create MongoDB User
Create a user in MongoDB with appropriate permissions for your application. This user will be used to authenticate connections from your application to the MongoDB instance. Assign the necessary roles, such as readWrite, to ensure the user has the required privileges to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

3. Configure Persistent Storage
To ensure MongoDB data persists beyond pod restarts, create a Persistent Volume (PV) and a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes. The PVC will allow your MongoDB pod to request storage resources from the PV, ensuring that the data is stored outside the pod, which can be lost if the pod is deleted or recreated.

4. Create Kubernetes Secret for MongoDB Credentials
To securely store sensitive information such as the MongoDB username and password, create a Kubernetes Secret. This Secret will be referenced by your MongoDB deployment and your application to authenticate to the database securely, without exposing the credentials directly in the code or deployment manifests.

5. Update Application Deployment Manifest
Update the Kubernetes deployment manifest of your application to reference the MongoDB instance. This involves adding environment variables or configuration options that define how the application should connect to MongoDB, including details such as the MongoDB URI, username, and password. These values will be provided from the Kubernetes Secret you created earlier.

6. Configure Application to Connect to MongoDB
In your application code, use the connection string to connect to MongoDB. This string will include the MongoDB server’s hostname, the database name, and the authentication details. Ensure your application uses the MongoDB client driver to interact with the database and handle operations like querying and updating data.

7. Test Deployment
After deploying MongoDB and your application, verify that the application can successfully connect to the database. Perform basic CRUD operations to ensure the connection is working as expected. This step will help confirm that MongoDB is properly configured and integrated with your application.

8. Set Up Backups and Disaster Recovery
Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies to protect your data. This can include using tools like mongodump to create backups of your MongoDB database, which can later be restored using mongorestore in case of data loss or failure. It’s important to schedule regular backups to ensure data integrity and minimize downtime in case of failure.

9. Monitor MongoDB and Application Performance
To ensure the database and application are running smoothly, set up monitoring tools. Kubernetes provides native monitoring capabilities, and you can also use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for more advanced monitoring. Additionally, MongoDB Atlas or the MongoDB Exporter can be used to monitor MongoDB-specific metrics like query performance, memory usage, and replication status.
