I Re-used the code from the previous task.
## Steps:
1) Install the google cloud SDK in your system.
2) After installation authenticate by giving this command "gcloud auth login".
3) set your GCP by using this command or by doing it manually in the GCR console "gcloud config set project sit737-2025-prac5d-455904".
4) Enable the container registry API.
5) Give all the required permission as owner, storage admin.
6) Check the billing which needs to be active.
7) Autenticate docker with google cloud using the command "gcloud auth configure-docker".
8) Tag the docker image for the GCR using the command "docker tag calculator gcr.io/sit737-2025-prac5d-455904/calculator:latest".
9) Now push the docker image to the GCR using the command "docker push gcr.io/sit737-2025-prac5d-455904/calculator:latest".
10) Lastly verify the image.
