  "description": "First we need to satrt with the installation of Docker on your system. Enabling containerization and the use of Docker CLI.  After setting up or cloning our web application (e.g., calculator.js) from our previous task, we created a Dockerfile to define the app's containerization process, specifying the base image, setting the working directory, copying source files, installing dependencies, exposing the necessary port (3040). Setting the start command. We then built the Docker image using the docker build command, naming it calculator-app. To simplify running the app in a container, we created a docker-compose.yml file that defined the service configuration, and launched the environment with docker-compose up. Testing was done by sending requests to the app's endpoints (e.g., /add and /health) via curl or a browser. Lastly, we pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub by tagging it and executing the docker push command, making it accessible from the cloud. By following all these steps given we now have successfully have demonstrated docker.",
